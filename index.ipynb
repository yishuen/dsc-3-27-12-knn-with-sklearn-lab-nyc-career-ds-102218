    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use KNN to make classification predictions on a real-world dataset\n",
    "* Perform a parameter search for 'k' to optimize model performance\n",
    "* Evaluate model performance and interpret results\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll make use of sklearn's implementation of the **_K-Nearest Neighbors_** algorithm. We'll use it to make predictions on the Titanic dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by importing the dataset, and then deal with preprocessing steps such as removing unnecessary columns and normalizing our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll find the titanic dataset stored in the `titanic.csv` file. In the cell below:\n",

    "Good job preprocessing our data! This can seem tedious, but its a very important foundational skill in any Data Science toolbox. The final step we we'll take in our preprocessing efforts is to **_Normalize_** our data. Recall that normalization (also sometimes called **_Standardization_** or **_Scaling_**) means making sure that all of our data is represented at the same scale.  The most common way to do this is to convert all numerical values to z-scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since KNN is a distance-based classifier, data on different scales and negatively affect the results of our model! Predictors on much larger scales will overwhelm data with much smaller scales, because euclidean distance is going to treat them as the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "To scale our data, we'll make use of the `StandardScaler` object found inside the `sklearn.preprocessing` module. \n",

    "In the cell below:\n",

    "* Import and instantiate a `StandardScaler` object. \n",
    "* Use the scaler's `.fit_transform()` method to create a scaled version of our dataset. \n",
    "* The result returned by the `fit_transform` call will be a numpy array, not a pandas DataFrame. Create a new pandas DataFrame out of this object called `scaled_df`. To set the column names back to their original state, set the `columns` parameter to `one_hot_df.columns`.\n",
